        <heading>Submission of Claims</heading>
        <text>Under this Ordinance, all claims made by the Employee for work related injuries/illness must be submitted to his/her immediate Supervisor/Director/Manager as soon as possible, but no later than three workdays after the incident occurs. The Employee is to complete a <em><u>First Report of Injury/Illness</u></em> form and a <em><u>Patient Authorization for Release of Information</u></em> form and submit them to their Supervisor/Director/Manager, who then co-signs the <em><u>First Report of Injury/Illness</u></em> form and immediately forwards both forms on to the Employer's Insurance Office. The Insurance Office will review the Report, and if warranted, will then, in a timely manner, forward the Report to the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider for evaluation and determination as to whether it is a valid claim under this Ordinance. The Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider will, within fourteen (14) workdays of their receipt of the Report, provide written notice to the Employer's Insurance Office as to whether the claim has been approved or denied. The Insurance Office will notify the appropriate personnel of the decision. If approved, the Employer's Insurance Office will process payment of benefits due and related health care expenses incurred as a result of this injury/illness.</text>
        <text>If denied, the Claims Administrator shall forward a written notice to the Employee and Plan Administrator. This notice shall contain the specific reason for the denial and clearly state the facts forming the basis of the denial. The denial must include information identifying the Employee, date of claimed injury, claim number, and instructions to the Employee of the rules and time limitations involved in the appeal process. The burden of proof of these facts is on the Employer. The facts arising under <cite path="XII|3|4|7">this section</cite> shall be determined by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>

In the case of mental or physical incapacity, the period of limitation shall be extended for fifteen (15) workdays from the initial date of occurrence. A repetitive traumatic injury or occupational disease is deemed to have occurred when the Supervisor/Director/Manager is notified that the injury or disease caused the Employee to be unable to work.</text>
        <text>The Plan Administrator shall supply the Employee's Supervisor/Director/Manager with any forms that may be required for completion, specifically the<u> Report of Work Ability</u> form that must be completed and submitted after each visit by the Employee with their Medical Provider. It is the responsibility of the Supervisor/Director/Manager to give such forms to the Employee for completion by either the Employee, their primary physician or approved Medical Provider. It is the responsibility of the Employee to return all completed forms to their Supervisor/Director/Manager, who will then immediately forward them on to the Plan Administrator.</text>
        <text>All medical records are to be forwarded to the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider. The Employee must continue to keep the Employer notified and advised during the course of treatment The Employee must cooperate with Employer in obtaining all related medical records. A failure to do so may result in the termination of benefits. The Employee shall not return to work without a written release from the primary physician or approved Medical Provider and the authorization from the Plan Administrator.</text>

Permanent partial disability benefits are not payable concurrently with temporary total/temporary partial benefits.
