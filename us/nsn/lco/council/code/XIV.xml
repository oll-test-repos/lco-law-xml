        <heading>General</heading>
        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="XIV|1|1.12">Subchapter 1.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

        <heading>Application</heading>
        <text>This ordinance shall govern all contracts and grants for the procurement of supplies, services, and construction entered into by the Tribe.  It shall apply to purchasing, irrespective of the source of funds, including contracts, which do not involve an obligation of funds (such as concession contracts); however, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the Tribe from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift, or bequest that is otherwise consistent with law.</text>
        <text>When both federal and non-federal funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified. The term "<em>procurement</em>," as used in this ordinance includes both contracts and modifications (including change orders) for construction or services, as well as purchase, lease, or rental of supplies and equipment.</text>

        <heading>Severability and Non-Liability</heading>
        <text>If any section, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

        <heading>Consistency with Good Business Practices</heading>
        <text>The fundamental goal of the Tribe's procurement system is to satisfy end users in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service while complying with applicable laws, rules, and the Tribe's own policies. Further, those involved in the procurement function should exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing best value product or services in meeting the tribe's needs.  Consistent with that goal, the CPO may assume that, if a specific strategy, practice, policy or product is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this procurement ordinance, the strategy, practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The CPO is advised to seek advice whenever doubts arise about an intended strategy, practice, policy or procedure.</text>

        <heading>Public Access to Procurement Information</heading>
        <text>Certain information about the Tribe's procurements are normally considered public (e.g. name of the winner contractor and total contract price) and may be released to the public in accordance with this procurement ordinance as well as applicable tribal laws and regulations governing information.</text>
        <text>Other information related to procurement is often protected from disclosure (e.g., proprietary business information such as technical methods or processes, detailed pricing information, personal information, or other information).  The Tribe must exercise caution to ensure that protected information is not made public. Contracting personnel should consult the Tribe's Legal Department whenever there is any question regarding the release of information.</text>

          <text>Generally, this procurement ordinance delegates responsibility for procurement functions to the Tribal Governing Board (hereinafter "TGB").  As established in Article V(1)(c) of the Lac Courte Oreilles Constitution and Bylaws dated November 2, 1966, the TGB has the power to exercise or limit any procedures, agreements, or contracts including this procurement ordinance.  Furthermore, projects developed with the use of federal monies are also subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990;  OMB Circular A-87; and Section 7(b) and (c) of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. §450e(c)).</text>

The CPO shall issue operational procedures, including procedures for the processing of purchase orders, to implement this ordinance. Violation of this ordinance, including the ethical standards, shall constitute insubordination and shall be subject to disciplinary action (which may include suspension and/or termination) by the TGB.</text>

        <text>Each contract or purchase action (e.g., new contract, modification, interagency agreement, purchase order, etc.) that obligates the Tribe to pay a contractor or vendor must be approved by the TGB or otherwise authorized by an individual to whom the Tribe has expressly delegated the authority to make such an obligation.</text>
        <text>The approval of the TGB on contracts is a legal commitment and requires continuing performance by the Tribe under the terms and conditions of the contact. Performance includes such duties as monitoring contractor performance and for the acceptance or rejection of contractors' requests for changes in performance, specification, or price.</text>
        <text><strong>Caution:</strong> Only the TGB is authorized to bind the Tribe by making an implied contract such as making a promise or stating an intent to purchase, either orally or in writing. Under the laws of the Tribe, the Tribe may be liable for, or bound by, an action of the CPO, or his/her designee only if the offeror has been given authority by the TGB. Therefore, all unapproved actions that could be misinterpreted as committing the TGB to purchase should be clarified with a statement such as, "this request for price quotation is not an offer to buy and should not be assumed as such."</text>

        <text>The Tribe should ensure that procurement employees have training and experience commensurate with the requirements of their duties. The Tribe should develop training and experience standards for their procurement positions and periodically review their procurement operations to ensure that procurement personnel meet those standards. The TGB should consider any changes in the procurement environment (e.g., new laws, regulations, market conditions, or buying needs and practices of the Tribe) when assessing the qualifications for personnel and the need for additional training.</text>

          <text>Planning is essential to managing the procurement function properly; however the type and extent of planning will depend on, among other factors, the method and size of the procurement, with larger and more complex procurements requiring more planning.</text>
          <para>
            <num>(a)</num>
            <text>Careful advance planning provides the Tribe with adequate time to accomplish its procurement actions. Advance planning helps to: maximize competitive pricing among contracts and decrease the Tribe's procurement costs; without any need for re-procurement, e.g., resolving bid protest; and minimize errors that occur when there is inadequate lead-time. Contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, and invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.</text>

          <para>

            <text>The Tribe should periodically review their record of prior purchases, as well as future needs to find patterns of procurement actions that could be performed more efficiently or economically. Items purchased repetitively might be obtained more economically through various master contracts. 	However, consideration should be given to storage, security, and 	handling requirements when planning these types of purchasing actions. 	For example, it may not be economical or prudent to buy truckloads of a product at deep discounts if there is no appropriate storage space for the product or if the cost of handling the product would exceed the savings price.</text>

          <text>While the CPO is responsible for the preparation of the ICE, other personnel (e.g., the end user, or budget and finance) are usually involved and may actually do most of the preparation.  The Tribe may develop the ICE using its own employees, outside parties (e.g., consultants), or a combination of the two. If any outside party (whether compensated or not) assists in developing the ICE, the Tribe must take the appropriate action to ensure that organizational conflicts of interest are avoided and that the outside party does not obtain any competitive advantage from its advance knowledge of the Tribe's cost estimate.</text>

The requirements for ICEs are:</text>

            <heading>For Purchases Less Than $3,000.</heading>
            <text>The CPO generally does not need to prepare an ICE. Price reasonableness normally will be based on a comparison with historical prices paid for the item, commercial catalog prices, or other offers.</text>

            <text>For Purchases above $3,000 but less than the Tribe's small purchase threshold ($150,000), documentation should be kept to a minimum. The ICE may be based on prior purchases, commercial catalogs, or detailed analyses (e.g., purchases for services).</text>

            <heading>For Purchases Above the Tribe's Small Purchase Threshold.</heading>
            <text>The level of detail will vary but should be commensurate with the size (i.e. dollar value), complexity, and commercial nature of the requirement. ICEs are normally broken out into major categories of cost (e.g., labor, materials, and other direct costs such as travel, overhead, and profit). Commercially available products and services may require less detail as the marketplace tends to provide current reliable pricing information for commercially available products; a CPO may also not need to break out components. Non-commercial type requirements, and work designed specifically for the tribe will require much more extensive estimation and detailed ICE.</text>

          <num>(5)</num>
          <text>The ICE serves as the primary in-house gauge of cost and price reasonableness, but it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of other sources of pricing information. Market conditions may fluctuate between the time the ICE is prepared and the receipt of offers. For example, materials or labor cost may have increased or decreased. If a significant period of time has elapsed, or the CPO knows that certain market conditions have changed, the CPO should request that an updated ICE be prepared to use in evaluating offers.</text>

          <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE:</strong>
        </text>
        <text>Eligibility for Indian preference shall be established in accordance with the requirements of federal law. If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training.</text>
        <text>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
        <text><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</text>
        <text><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</text>
        <text><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
        <text>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</text>
        <text>Unrestricted Solicitations.  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</text>
        <text>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
        <text>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</text>
        <text>
          <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>
        </text>
        <text>
          <em>If the bid from the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise of organization is within the (15%) range of the lowest, non-Indian firm, the Indian-owned firm will be given the opportunity to meet the lowest bid price. Should the Indian-owned firm refuse to meet this lower price, the bid shall then be awarded to the responsive and responsible low bidder for the project.</em>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The LCOHA is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="XI|7">11 LCOTCL Chapter 7</cite>. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCOHA, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="XIV|4|4.12">Subchapter 4.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on LCOHA operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

However, similar to the United States government, Indian tribes are expressly exempted from the definition of a covered "employer." Consistent with this exemption, the Tribe grants Indian preference in employment, and will apply preference in the following order when there are two or more candidates that meet the job qualifications:</text>

Employees must notify their department head or director or the LCOHA Human Resource Director, or designee, in writing of any requested reasonable accommodation within a reasonable period of time after the employee learns of the need for such accommodation.</text>

The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

          <text>While the Tribe/LCOHA encourages its employees to enjoy and make good use of their off-duty time, certain activities on the part of employees may become a concern if they have the effect of impairing the work of any employee; harassing, demeaning, or creating a hostile working environment for any employee; disrupting the smooth and orderly flow of work within the office; or harming the goodwill and reputation of the Tribe. In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the LCOHA and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the LCOHA supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>

            <text>If you have a work related or personal problem that you think the LCOHA can help you resolve, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor. Your supervisor is usually in the best position to help you.</text>

Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <text>The LCO-CHC is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="III|5">Title III, Chapter 5</cite> of the LCOTCL – Community Health Center Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to <cite path="II|5">Title II, Chapter 5</cite> of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCO-CHC, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="XIV|5|5.12">Subchapter 5.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

However, the LCO-CHC looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the LCO-CHC's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <text>The School is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="VII|7">7 LCOTCL Chapter 7</cite>. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the School, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of <cite path="XIV|7|7.12">Subchapter 7.12</cite>, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on School operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

          <text><u>Problem Solving Process</u>. When people work closely together it is only natural that problems, questions or conflict may sometimes arise. It is in the best interest of the School and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the School supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>

            <num>(a)</num>
            <text>If you have a work related or personal problem that you think the School can help you resolve, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor. Your supervisor is usually in the best position to help you.</text>

            <text>If you do not get an answer, or you are not satisfied with the answer, the issue should be written down and presented to the Human Resources Director.  The Human Resources Director will facilitate a meeting to assist with mutually resolving the issue.</text>

Problems arise in all work places and this process is designated to identify and correct those problems and issues in a fair, equitable and timely manner. It should be noted that not all problems or issues will have an outcome that all parties agree with but in no circumstances will insubordinate behavior or communications be tolerated.</text>

          <text>All hours spent attending Conferences shall be counted as work time for purposes of compensation, or accrual of compensatory time, as applicable, unless ALL of the following four criteria are met: (1) attendance is outside of the employee's regular working hours; (2) attendance is in fact voluntary; (3) the Conference is not directly related to the employee's job; and (4) the employee does not perform any productive work during such attendance.  For example, if a payroll clerk attends a one-day Conference to learn accounting software, and the Conference lasts ten (9) hours, and has a one (1) hour lunch, the employee has nine (9) hours work time.</text>
          <para>

            <text>Attendance is not voluntary, of course, if the employer requires it. It is not voluntary in fact if the employee is given to understand or led to believe that his present working conditions or the continuance of his employment would be adversely affected by nonattendance.</text>

            <text>The training is directly related to the employee's job if it is designed to make the employee handle his job more effectively as distinguished from training him for another job, or to a new or additional skill.  For example, a stenographer who is given a course in stenography is engaged in an activity to make her a better stenographer. Time spent in such a course given by the employer or under his auspices is hours worked. However, if the stenographer takes a course in bookkeeping, it may not be directly related to her job. Thus, the time she spends voluntarily in taking such a bookkeeping course, outside of regular working hours, need not be counted as working time. Where a training course is instituted for the bona fide purpose of preparing for advancement through upgrading the employee to a higher skill, and is not intended to make the employee more efficient in his present job, the training is not considered directly related to the employee's job even though the course incidentally improves his skill in doing his regular work.</text>

            <num>(d)</num>
            <text>There are some special situations where the time spent in attending lectures, training sessions and courses of instruction is not regarded as hours worked. For example, an employer may establish for the benefit of his employees a program of instruction that corresponds to courses offered by independent bona fide institutions of learning. Voluntary attendance by an employee at such courses outside of working hours would not be hours worked even if they are directly related to his job, or paid for by the employer.</text>

Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

PTO schedules will be determined on a first come first served basis. Prior to the utilization of accrued PTO, team members must schedule and have the use of accrued PTO time approved so it will not interfere with job responsibilities, except as otherwise provided by law. If a team member is on PTO and there is early release or closure of the team member's worksite, the team member shall be credited any such leave during the period of early release or closure. If requesting more than three (3) days of PTO time team members shall obtain prior authorization at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the leave date. The Director/Manager may or may not approve such request depending on a variety of factors, including schedules. In extreme emergency situations the Director/Manager, in consultation with an Executive Team Member, may waive the forty-eight (48) hours notification provision, if requested by the team member in writing citing the reason.</text>

          <text>Being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication in the team member's work environment is normally just-cause for the team member to be referred for alcohol and drug testing. However, being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication does not excuse a team member's misconduct that violates any of the employer's rules, policies, procedures, or regulations. For example, an assault committed while subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication will subject the team member to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, because of the misconduct.</text>

        <heading>General</heading>
        <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

        <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
        <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

        <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
        <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

Nothing precludes the Human Resource Director, or designee, in testing for substances which are not included on this list, should the Superintendent, or designee, determine it is in the best interests of the Tribe to include substances which are not listed above to ensure a drug free workplace.

    <text>The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (hereinafter "Band" or "Tribe") in an effort to diversify the economy of the Tribe's reservation in order to improve the Tribe's economic self-sufficiency petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to issue a charter of corporation pursuant to section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act, codified at U.S.C. § 5124. The BIA – Midwest Regional Office issued a certificate of incorporation for the Big Fish Golf Corporation (hereinafter "Big Fish Golf Corp" or "BFGC"). Big Fish Golf Corp is a legal entity wholly owned by the Tribe, but distinct and separate from the Tribe.</text>
    <text>This personnel policy and procedural manual is enacted pursuant to the management authority of the Board of Directors of the Big Fish Golf Corp.
