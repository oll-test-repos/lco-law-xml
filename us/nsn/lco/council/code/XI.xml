These procedures are intended to implement a full system of maintenance for those units where the Housing Authority has the obligation to perform the maintenance as required. Therefore, the purpose of the Housing Authority's maintenance procedures shall be to:</text>

A Qualified Contractor will consist of a contractor who has hazardous waste expertise and is certified to conduct clean-up operations in a meth contaminated condition. Contractors who have not been certified in a similar program should, at minimum, complete the 40-hour HAZWOPER training (OSHA <cite path="cfr 1910.120">29 CFR § 1910.120</cite>). The contractors will need to provide the Housing Authority with documentation of completion for each employee who will be doing meth remediation. A Clearance test will be performed by a third-party test to insure the unit has been cleaned to at or below the Housing Authority set standard. The Housing Authority will pay for the first clearance test, if this test fails the Housing Authority will pay half the cost of the second test and the qualified contractor will be responsible to cover the other half of the testing cost. If the second test were to fail then the contractor will be responsible to cover all cost associated with the third test and any other testing after that. The Housing Authority shall hold $1500.00 from each remediation contract to cover the cost of testing until the unit passes a clearance test. Cleanup pertaining to these units shall have a scope of work established by the Housing Authority Inspector. This may require removal of all woodwork, any porous material, all affected cabinets and countertops, replace appliances and any other area as determined by the inspector and as written in the scope of work.</text>

        <heading>Purpose</heading>
        <text>The purpose of <cite path="XI|7|7.12">this Subchapter</cite> is to set forth the guidelines and procedures related to the temporary relocation of housing participants by the Housing Authority. These guidelines are established as a result of 49 CFR Part 24 - Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Regulations for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs (hereinafter "URA"). Prior to HUD approval for any grant, contract; or agreement requiring relocation activity under which federal funds provide financial assistance, the Housing Authority must provide a certification of compliance that it will comply with the URA. The Housing Authority will take appropriate measures to carry out the requirements contained in this policy in a manner that minimizes fraud, waste, and mismanagement. Instances of fraud and waste will be handled appropriately by the Housing Authority or referred to HUD's Office of Inspector General.</text>

        <text>Treasury will make initial payments from the HAF Program available to eligible entities that are approved to participate in the HAF Program, in an amount equal to 10% of the total amount allocated to the eligible entity. In order to receive this initial payment, The Tribe must (1) enter into the ﬁnancial assistance agreement with Treasury described above, and (2) commit to use the funds only for qualiﬁed expenses other than <cite path="XI|9|9.8|9.802|(9)">subsection (9)</cite> of the "Qualiﬁed Expenses" section above. Treasury will make payments to the Tribe, or an agency of the eligible entity identiﬁed on the eligible entity's notice of funds request. No more than 50% of the initial payment may be used for planning, community engagement, needs assessment, and administrative expenses described in <cite path="XI|9|9.8|9.802|(10)">subsection (10)</cite> of the "Qualiﬁed Expenses" section above. An eligible entity that elects not to receive this initial payment may receive its allocated funds after Treasury approves its HAF plan. Treasury encourages HAF participants to use these initial payments to create or fund pilot programs to serve targeted populations, and to focus on programs that are most likely to deliver resources most quickly to targeted populations, such as mortgage reinstatement programs.</text>
