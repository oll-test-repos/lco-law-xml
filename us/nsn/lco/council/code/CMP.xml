        <heading>Submission of Claims</heading>
        <text>Under this Ordinance, all claims made by the Employee for work related injuries/illness must be submitted to his/her immediate Supervisor/Director/Manager as soon as possible, but no later than three workdays after the incident occurs. The Employee is to complete a <em><u>First Report of Injury/Illness</u></em> form and a <em><u>Patient Authorization for Release of Information</u></em> form and submit them to their Supervisor/Director/Manager, who then co-signs the <em><u>First Report of Injury/Illness</u></em> form and immediately forwards both forms on to the Employer's Insurance Office. The Insurance Office will review the Report, and if warranted, will then, in a timely manner, forward the Report to the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider for evaluation and determination as to whether it is a valid claim under this Ordinance. The Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider will, within fourteen (14) workdays of their receipt of the Report, provide written notice to the Employer's Insurance Office as to whether the claim has been approved or denied. The Insurance Office will notify the appropriate personnel of the decision. If approved, the Employer's Insurance Office will process payment of benefits due and related health care expenses incurred as a result of this injury/illness.</text>
        <text>If denied, the Claims Administrator shall forward a written notice to the Employee and Plan Administrator. This notice shall contain the specific reason for the denial and clearly state the facts forming the basis of the denial. The denial must include information identifying the Employee, date of claimed injury, claim number, and instructions to the Employee of the rules and time limitations involved in the appeal process. The burden of proof of these facts is on the Employer. The facts arising under <cite path="§CMP.6.4.010">this section</cite> shall be determined by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>

        <text>Positions will be held for an Employee with legitimate compensable injury or illness for up to three (3) months for the return of the Employee. The Employer, at the end of three (3) months, can reassess the Employee's position and may fill that position with a permanent replacement Employee. Prior to return to work, the Employee must be cleared for return to work through the primary physician or approved Medical Provider, and a completed <em><u>Report of Work Ability</u></em> form must be submitted as set forth in <cite path="§CMP.6.4.020">Section CMP.6.4.020</cite> of this Ordinance.</text>
        <text>The Employer will make every effort to provide light duty and modified work to the injured Employee after the injured employee has sought medical treatment and has provided the Employer with the appropriate <em><u>Return to Work Restrictions</u></em> paperwork. If an injured Employee refuses the light duty or modified work position offered by the Employer, all medical and other benefits will cease immediately. Light duties will be facilitated through the Employer when deemed appropriate by the Claims Administrator/Managed Care Provider.</text>
